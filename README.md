The Ukrainian Open-Source community is an initiative to enhance the quality and visibility of Ukrainian open-source projects, promoting collaboration, and connecting developers eager to contribute to these projects. This community aims to create an ecosystem where developers, both experienced and newcomers, can find good projects to work on, share knowledge, and collectively solve problems.
